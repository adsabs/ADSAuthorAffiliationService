    $ source python/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    $ vim local_config.py # edit, edit

## API

#### Make a request:

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d <payload> <endpoint>

### Step 1: Get Data

To get data the
* `<endpoint>` is `https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/author-affiliation/search`, and
* `<payload>` should contain a JSON code of a list of comma separated 
bibcodes, and two optional parameters, maxauthor (num of authors to consider 
for each article, default is 0, to include all) and numyears 
(only include articles with publication year in the past numyears years, default is past 4 years)


For example to return *all* authors and their affiliations for the past *4 years* of the two articles with bibcodes 2017arXiv170909566R, 2016SPIE.9910E..0AM, you would do   

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"bibcode":["2017arXiv170909566R","2016SPIE.9910E..0AM"],"maxauthor":0, "numyears":4}' https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/author-affiliation/search


### Step 2: Format Data

To format data the
* `<endpoint>` is `https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/author-affiliation/export`, and
* `<payload>` should contain a JSON code of a list of comma separated three-value fields 
of author, affiliation, and last active date, separated by a '|', and export format that 
is one of the followings:
`

    "| Lastname, Firstname | Affiliation | Last Active Date | [csv]"
    
    "| Lastname | Firstname | Affiliation | Last Active Date | [csv]"
    
    "| Lastname, Firstname | Affiliation | Last Active Date | [excel]"
    
    "| Lastname | Firstname | Affiliation | Last Active Date | [excel]"
    
    "Lastname, Firstname(Affiliation)Last Active Date[text]"
    
    "Lastname, Firstname(Affiliation)Last Active Date[browser]"
`

For example to output a spreadsheet using the *text* format, for the two publications of *Accomazzi, A.*, you would do

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your API token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"selected":["Accomazzi, A.|Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, USA|2015/04", "Accomazzi, A.|SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System, USA|2015/04"], "format":"Lastname, Firstname(Affiliation)Last Active Date[text]"}' https://api.adsabs.harvard.edu/v1/author-affiliation/export`
